You 're beautiful , but you 're empty ...
One could n't die for you .
Of course , an ordinary passerby would think my rose looked just like you .
But my rose , all on her own , is more important than all of you together , since she 's the one I 've watered .
Since she 's the one I put under glass , since she 's the one I sheltered behind the screen .
Since she 's the one for whom I killed the caterpillars ( except the two or three butterflies ) .
Since she 's the one I listened to when she complained , or when she boasted , or even sometimes when she said nothing at all.
Since she 's my rose .
